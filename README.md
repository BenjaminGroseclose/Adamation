# Adamation
AI designed for conversation with emotional reactions

	The goal of this project is to create an artificial intelligence that mimics the human mind as much as possible. For instance, the human mind has the ability to associate thoughts with one another in the form of neurons and the synaptic links between these neurons. In the same way, This program has thought objects that link to each-other via links which represent synaptic links. When the mind starts a thought process, the synaptic links fire and the mind travels through the link of thoughts to reach a conclusion or response.
	
	The Adamation will have a folder containing it's long term memory. It will also have a smaller place for short term memory. This is essentially the minds RAM. A processor works between these two to make sense of the short term memory and place it into long term memory.
	
	Adamation design umls can be found in the design folder of this project.
